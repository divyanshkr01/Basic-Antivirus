There are 5 Folders.      Archive was for the Code we were previously working on, but it is outdated now.      Backline has codes that do not work properly.      Back-Up is just for the backup folder.      FrontEnd contains the FrontEnd codes (Not Responsive).      Streamline contains the working features of the Code.
